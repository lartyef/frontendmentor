### What I learned

I learned about two amzing colors

```css
.left {
 color: hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
}
.contatiner {
    background-color: hsl(216, 50%, 16%); 
}
### Continued development

I like to focus more on the use of flex box and responsiveness

### Useful resources

- (https://www.w3school.com) - This helped me to grasp the use of flex box reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
